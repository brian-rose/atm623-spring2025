# Class schedule

Here you can find the subject matter and assigned reading for every class day as well as expected homework dates.

**Please check back here frequently** as the schedule is subject to change.

The class meets **every Monday, Wednesday 1:10 - 2:30 PM** in **ETEC 482**.

Much of the course content is accessible from [The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/). Note that assigned readings should be completed *before class* so you are ready to discuss the material.
